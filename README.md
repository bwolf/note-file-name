## Synopsis

**mk-note-file-name** is a small emacs lisp library for building
unique note file names consisting of the current date, followed by a
letter suffix (building a positional numeral sytem to the base 26
where each digit is mapped to the letters of the alphabet `[a-z]`
where the first letter `a` is the identity element under addition),
followed by keywords (separated by spaces) and a file extension.

## Examples
```emacs-lisp
(setq dir (expand-file-name "~/Documents"))
(find-file (mg/note-file-name-make-unique-file-name dir ".markdown" "foo" "bar"))
=> "/Users/someuser/Documents/20140419a foo bar.markdown"
(find-file (mg/note-file-name-make-unique-file-name dir ".markdown" "foo" "bar"))
=> "/Users/someuser/Documents/20140419b foo bar.markdown"
```
